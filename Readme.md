## Excuse Chatbot

## English

This project is a simple Flask-based **excuse generator chatbot** that responds in **English or Korean** depending on the user's input language, with a **Dark Mode** UI.

- **Detect Input Language**  
  If the user’s question is in **English**, the chatbot will reply in English.  
  If the user’s question is in **Korean**, the chatbot will reply in Korean.

- **UI Language Toggle**  
  The top-right buttons let you toggle the **UI text** (buttons, placeholders, etc.) between Korean and English.
